GCP Cost Optimization and Cost Reduction
This repository contains a project aimed at optimizing and reducing cloud costs in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It provides a systematic approach to analyze resource usage, optimize services, and apply best practices to minimize costs.

Features
Cost Analysis: Analyze detailed billing data and resource usage to identify cost drivers.
Optimization Recommendations: Provides insights into potential savings by optimizing cloud components such as Compute, Storage, Networking, etc.
Automated Cost Reports: Generate cost reports with visualizations for better understanding and decision-making.
Custom Forecasting: Forecast future costs using historical data.
Resource Management: Identify underutilized resources and suggest actions like resizing or deletion.
Key Components
Cost Breakdown:

Break down costs by services, regions, and resource types.
Visual representation of historical and forecasted costs.
Optimization Techniques:

Rightsizing of VMs.
Use of committed use contracts and sustained use discounts.
Storage optimization (e.g., lifecycle policies, nearline storage).
Network cost analysis and reduction strategies.
Forecasting:

Predict future costs based on past usage.
Visualize trends for better cost management.
Automated Alerts:

Set up alerts for overspending.
Track spending against budget thresholds.
